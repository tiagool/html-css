<blockquote cite="https://www.google.com.br/books/edition/Beginning_Web_Programming_with_HTML_XHTM/mwrf1EMOcskC?hl=pt-BR&gbpv=0"> on Duckett published his first Web site in 1996 while studying for a BSc (Hons) in Psychology at Brunel University, London. Since then he has helped create a wide variety of Web sites and has co-written more than ten programming-related books on topics from ASP to XML (via many other letters of the alphabet) covering diverse aspects of Web programming including design, architecture, and coding. After graduation, Jon worked for Wrox Press first in its Birmingham (UK) offices for three years and then in Sydney, Australia, for another year. He is now a freelance developer and consultant based in a leafy suburb of London, working for a range of clients spread across three continents. When not stuck in front of a computer screen, Jon enjoys listening to music and writing.
